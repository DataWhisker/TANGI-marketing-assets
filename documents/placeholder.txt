This is a placeholder file to ensure the documents folder is included in the Git repository.

In a real repository, this folder would contain:
- Whitepapers and technical documentation
- Presentation slide decks
- User guides and tutorials
- Press releases and media kits

Please refer to the README.md file in this folder for guidelines on adding document assets.
