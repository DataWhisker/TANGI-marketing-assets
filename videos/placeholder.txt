This is a placeholder file to ensure the videos folder is included in the Git repository.

In a real repository, this folder would contain:
- Promotional videos showcasing TANGI features
- Tutorial videos explaining how to use TANGI
- Animated explainer videos
- Team interviews and community updates

Please refer to the README.md file in this folder for guidelines on adding video assets.

Note: Large video files should use Git LFS or be linked from external hosting services.
